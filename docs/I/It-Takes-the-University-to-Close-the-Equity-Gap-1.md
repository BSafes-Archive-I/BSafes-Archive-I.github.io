## Defining the Equity Gap: Language Matters
The term equity gap has been used synonymously with achievement gap and opportunity gap in the existing literature. In concrete terms, the gap is represented as the difference in performance outcomes (i.e., course GPA and/or success rate) between DWS and DSC. For example, referred to as the “achievement gap” in their study, Yue et al. (2018) define it as the “gap which exists between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged students and their mean final course grade” (Yue et al., 2018, p. 19). Similarly, Anderson et al. (2007) defined it in terms of a difference in test scores between demographic groups. Using the same term, The National Center for Education Statistics (2015) stated that the achievement gap occurs “when one group of students (such as, students grouped by race/ethnicity, gender) outperforms another group and the difference in average scores for the two groups is statistically significant.” The problem is that these definitions tap into how the gap is **measured** rather than its root causes.

Labels matter. Language matters. Scholars such as Flores (2018) take issue with the term “achievement gap” because it places blame on the student for the difference in performance outcomes and suggests that the cause of lower performance levels is inherent in the students’ racial identities. Flores (2018) suggests that “(re)framing the language away from the deficit perspective associated with the use of the term achievement gap can shift educators toward recognizing institutional school cultures and practices that influence disparities” (p. 345). Consider the shift toward root causes of the gap when reframed as an “opportunity gap”: “The way that uncontrollable life factors like race, language, economic, and family situations can contribute to lower rates of success in educational achievement, careerprospects, and other life aspirations” (Close The Gap Foundation, 2021)

Redefining the gap as an “equity gap or opportunity gap” rather than an “achievement gap” helps us to examine the root causes for the differences in performance outcomes. “Achievement gap” puts the onus on students because academics become the sole focus, and stakeholders fail to consider the relevance of finances and environment.
