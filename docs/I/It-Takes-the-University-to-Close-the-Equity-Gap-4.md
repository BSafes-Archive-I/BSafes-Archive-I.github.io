## Conclusion
The equity gap contributes to lower success rates for domestic students of color, increases the overall cost of higher education, and in the larger scheme, continues to exacerbate social justice concerns. The equity gap was created from academic, financial, and environmental inequities, and it must be closed with actions that consider such barriers. Therefore, a universitywide effort is crucial. Faculty and support staff can consider their educational environments and adapt their pedagogical strategies to be inclusive of all students. Administrators can invest in resources that serve the needs of all students academically, examine and adjust inequitable policies and practices, and diversify their workforce. It is the responsibility of all of us as stakeholders in higher education to do what we can to close the equity gap and contribute to the success of all students.
