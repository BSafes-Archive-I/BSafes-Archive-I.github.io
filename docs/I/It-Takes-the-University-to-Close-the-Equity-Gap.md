## Abstract
Measured as the difference in performance outcomes between domestic students of color and domestic white students, the equity gap is rooted in systemic racism and a lack of educational opportunities. The equity gap has ramifications for all stakeholders in higher education, especially for domestic students of color. In this paper, we explore the causes of the equity gap and why it requires a university-wide effort to close it. Potential solutions in closing it are offered based on our experiences at Minnesota State University, Mankato. 

*Keywords*: equity gap, opportunity gap, inclusion, supplemental instruction

## It Takes the University to Close the Equity Gap
“What is the equity gap, and why should I care about it?” These are questions asked by students, staff, faculty, and administrators in recent times when issues pertaining to diversity, equity, and inclusion have come to the forefront due to increasing racial tensions in American society. The equity gap is measured as the gap in performance outcomes between domestic White students (DWS) and domestic students of color (DSC) (e.g., Yue et al. 2018). As partners in education, it is easy to assume that this has nothing to do with us because stakeholders in education are committed to offering equal educational opportunities to all students. Therefore, we dismiss the suggestion that gaps in performance outcomes between DWS, and DSC have anything to do with us.

The reality is that the equity gap has roots in education as well as in other societal institutions (American Council on Education, 2020). Additionally, the population of undergraduate students who identify as a race other than White has increased from 30% to 45% in just the last 20 years (Espinosa et al., 2019). Therefore, those institutions that can recruit and graduate DSC will likely have more stable enrollments and budgets. Finally, the equity gap is associated with academic, financial, and environmental factors (American Council on Education, 2020). Therefore, it will take all of us as stakeholders in higher education (students, staff, faculty, and administrators) to close the equity gap. Using both the existing literature and our experiences, this paper seeks to define the equity gap and its root causes and then, based on our mistakes and achievements at Minnesota State University, Mankato (MSUM), we offer practical suggestions in closing the gap.
